# Enigma Machine

This Python code represents a simplified version of the Enigma machine, a cipher device used during World War II for encryption and decryption of secret messages. The Enigma machine was employed by various military and government agencies of several countries, most notably by Nazi Germany before and during World War II.

## Overview

The Enigma machine consisted of a series of rotating disks, or rotors, that scrambled plaintext letters into ciphertext. The settings of these rotors determined the encryption algorithm. This implementation includes functionality for encryption and decryption using a simplified version of the Enigma machine.

## Usage

To use this implementation, follow these steps:

1. **Instantiate the Enigma class**: Create an instance of the `enigma` class.

2. **Configure the rotor settings**: Set the initial configuration of the rotors by specifying the order and positions of the rotors.

3. **Encrypt or decrypt a message**: Input a message to be encrypted or decrypted.

4. **View the result**: The encrypted or decrypted message will be displayed.

Model and Number: "GERMAN RAILWAY(ROCKET)"
Additional Information
This implementation uses a simplified version of the Enigma machine with three rotors and a reflector. The rotor mappings and functions are organized within the enigma class to allow
for easy configuration and operation.
Note that this implementation does not include all features and complexities of the original Enigma machine. It serves as a basic demonstration of the concept of rotor-based encryption.
